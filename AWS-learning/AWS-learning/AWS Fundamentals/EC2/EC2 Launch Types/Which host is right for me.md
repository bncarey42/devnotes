# Which host is right for me
on demand: coming and staying in hotel whenever we like, we pay the full price

reserved: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount

spot instance: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. you can get kicked out at any time

dedicated Hosts: we book an entire building or wing of the hotel
