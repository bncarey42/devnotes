# Public vs Public IP (IPv4)
Networking vs Public IP (IPv4)

Networking has two sorts of IPs. IPv4 and IPv6:

IPv4: `1.160.10.240`

IPv6: `3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf`

IPv4 is more common used online

IPv6 is newer and is primarily used to solve problems for the IoT

IPv4 allows for 3.7 billion different addresses in the public space

IPv4 `[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]`

### Example

Public IP:

Public IP means the machine can be identified on the internet (www)

must be unique across the whole web

can be geo-located easily

Private IP:

Private IP means the machine can only be identified on a private network only

the IP must be unique across the private Â network

BUT two different private networks can have the same IPs

Machines connect to WWW using a NAT + internet gateway (a proxy)

Only a specified range of IPs can be used as private IP
