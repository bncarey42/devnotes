# Sharding
Shards split an index into smaller pieces

can be spread across multiple machines

Sharding increases the number of documents an index can store

Sharding makes it easier to fit large indices onto nodes

sharding may improve query throughput (performance)

an index defaults to having one shrd

add a couple of shards for large indices; otherwise use default settings
